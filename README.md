This is to practice flask and pandas:  
there is a .csv file with words and their definitions.  
user goes to a website and sees intstructions on which url to use and how to search a word.  
user then copies the provided ulr into a url bar and types any word  
a document opens in a json format:  
{  'definition': "word's definition",  
    'word': "user's entered word"  
    }  
if there is no word in a dictionary, or if user changes the url, a default not-found page opens.
